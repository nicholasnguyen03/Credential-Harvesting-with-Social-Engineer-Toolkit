# Credential-Harvesting-with-Social-Engineer-Toolkit
This mini-lab demonstrates a simulated phishing attack using the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) on Kali Linux. The goal is to clone a legitimate website (Google), capture user credentials via a fake login form, and observe how credential harvesting works in a controlled, ethical lab environment.
